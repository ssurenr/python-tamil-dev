# Python Tamil Dev
Collection of Python tools for Tamil computing as a container image

## The container image
The image can be pulled from `ghcr.io/ssurenr/python-tamil-dev:main`.  
It can be used like the [official python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) for development. However, there are no image variants built like the official image.  
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the list of packages added.
